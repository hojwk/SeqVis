<p>
A range of statistical and visual analysis tools are provided in SeqVis to help determining the extend of compositional heterogeneity.

<b>Heterogeneity Analysis</b><br>
In this analysis, all point is assigned a colour to indicate how far is it from the centroid of all points. Points closest to the centroid are coloured in blue while, while points furthest
away from the centroid coloured in red.

<b><i>k</i>-mean clustering</b><br>
This algorithm divide all the points into <i>k</i> clusters. User will be prompted for a value
 of <i>k</i>. 
</p>

<p>

<b>Hierarchical Clustering</b><br>
Euclidean distance between each point is measured, then clustered hierarchically. An average-linked
method is used.
</p>

<b>Matched-Pair Test</b><br>
Using Bowker's test for symmetry, a probability that two sequences are homogeneous is measured for each pair of sequences.
</p>

<p>
<b>Self-Organizing Clustering (SOC) </b><br>
An improved version of <i>k</i>-mean clustering, where we do not have to know the number of cluster in advance. For deatilas of SOC, please refer to  Amano <i>et al</i>. <a href="#amano_bib">(2003)</a>
