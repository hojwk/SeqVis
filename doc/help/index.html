SeqVis is an interactive visualization tool for analyzing large alignment of nucleotide compositions.
It uses a novel tetrahedron model (a three dimensional extension to the de Finetti plot) 
to map nucleotide composition (i.e. frequency of A, T, G and C) into 3D space. 
This tool allows user to detect the extent and direction of compositional heterogeneity
among multiple sequences and across codon sites.

This user guide is only accurate up to SeqVis version 1.3. A number functionalities have been renamed in version 1.4
and these (minor) changes have not been incoporated into this user guide yet.
