			We extended the de Finetti plot (Fig. 1) Cannings and Edwards, 1968) to a
tetrahedral plot (Fig. 2) with similar properties (i.e., each observation comprises
four variables, a, b, c, and d, where a + b + c + d = 1
and 0 &le; a, b, c, d &le; 1). Each axis in the plot starts at the center of
a surface at value 0, and finishes at the opposite corner at value 1. We model the four 
variables in this model to be frequency of nucleotide A, T, G and C in a sequence. Therefore, each 
sequence can be uniquely represented as a point inside the tetrahedron. For example, a point lying close to 
the corner T will contain an exceeding large proportion of T compared to A,G and C in that sequence. 
If the alignment of sequences evolved under compositional stationary condition, we will expect to see
all points to be very closely clustered inside the tetrahedron. Thus, visual assessment of the spread of
 points in the tetrahedron shows the extend of compositional heterogeneity.
