<p>
<img src="images/search_name.png"><br>
<strong>Sequence Search by Name</strong>
Search for a sequence or a set of sequences by sequence name. All matching sequence's must contain the search string as an exact substring. Matching sequences will be highlighted on screen.
</p>

<p>

<strong>Sequence Search by Sub-Sequence</strong>
Search for a sequence or a set of sequences by sub-sequence. All matching sequence must contain the search string as an exact substring. Matching sequences will be highlighted on screen. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/add_seq.png"><br>
<strong>Add New Sequences</strong>
Add new sequence(s) to the dataset by manually entering the name and the nucleotide sequence of the sequence.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/display_seq.png"><br>
<strong>Display Sequences details</strong>
Show the name of the sequence. The sequences are also allowed to be displayed/hidden.
</p>

<strong>Lower Dimensions View</strong>
Visualize the dataset in a lower dimensional model (a triangular de Finetti plot or a linear plot). In lower dimensions view, composition of two nucleotides are pooled together.
