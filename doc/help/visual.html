<p>
The view menu provides a range of functionalities to manipulate the visualization.
</p>
<img src="images/view.png">

<p>
<strong>Codon/Single View</strong>
Toggle between the codon view or the single view. A codon view allows three tetrahedron to be displayed next to each other on the screen. The single view displays only one tetrahedron. Codon view is only active on whole sequence mode.
</p>

<p>

<strong>Toggle Wireframe</strong>
Show or hide the wire frame for the tetrahedron
</p>

<p>
<strong>Model Content</strong>
Model content can be selected. Available model content includes:
<ul>
	<li>Whole Sequence - using nucleotide from the whole sequence
	<li>Codon 1 - using nucleotide only at the first codon site
	<li>Codon 2 - using nucleotide only at the second codon site
	<li>Codon 3 - using nucleotide only at the third codon site
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Toggle Axes</strong>
Display or hide the axes. The visibility of the axes can be controlled collectively or individually.
</p>

<strong>Toggle Base Labels</strong>
Display or hide the labels (the letters A,T,G,C at each vertex of the tetrahedron)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Set All Points Color</strong>
Assign one colour to all the points inside the tetrahedron. A separate colour-choosing window will pop-up.
</p>


<p>
<img src="images/frame_color.png"><br>
<strong>Set Frame Color</strong>
Assign the colour of the frame. The colour of the frame (ie the edge of tetrahedron) as well as the colour of the labels corresponding to those edges will be changed.
</p>


<p>

<strong>Set Background</strong>
Assign the colour for the background
</p>


<p>
<strong>Auto Rotate</strong>
Start up the automatic rotation of tetrahedron. The direction and the speed of rotation can be dynamically adjusted by mouse dragging the tetrahedron. For example, dragging the tetrahedron to the right slowly will result in slow rotation of the tetrahedron to the right.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Level Plane</strong>
In order to aid visualizing depth in 3D, a level plane can be displayed. A level plane is the triangular plane opposite each vertex. The location of the level plane can be controlled by keyboard action. 
<ul>
	<li><b>UP: </b> move the level plane vertically upward
	<li><b>DOWN: </b> move the level plane vertically downward
	<li><b>LEFT: </b> decrease the transparency of the plane
	<li><b>RIGHT: </b> increase the transparency of the plane
</ul>
</p>
